# Zumo Autonomous Car
A mini self-driving robot that combines line following, obstacle avoidance, and point-to-point navigation using the Zumo32U4 platform.

## Project Overview
This project simulates a simplified autonomous vehicle using the Pololu Zumo32U4 robot. The robot can:
- Follow a black line using calibrated reflectance sensors
- Detect and avoid static and dynamic obstacles in real time
- Transition to waypoint-based navigation using encoder-based odometry
